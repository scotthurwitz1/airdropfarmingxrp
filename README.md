# airdropfarmingxrp
scripts for farming airdrops on the xrp ledger. 

I noticed the opportunity to earn a return on xrp tokens by
creating a "staking" type bundle of scripts that lock xrp tokens into "trustlines" in exchange for 
marketing airdrops from token creators. 

Here are a selection of examples of my experience using my data science skills and the xrpl-py package to coordinate
and manage actions on the ledger for a cluster of several thousand individual "accounts" in order to facilitate
the airdrop farming process. 

account data export- generating new wallets and exporting their data

harvest xrp- collecting profits from each account to a hub

offer create- executing sell orders on the ledger for each account

trust add- adding trust lines for each account
